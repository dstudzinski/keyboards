In this directory you can find the file for Corel Draw X4 and exported PDF file with vector cover visible on photos.
Bottom cover was extracted from PCB design. Controller cover was based on nice!nano V2 PCB design. Black 'rows' are rows
for 'bumps' of the pins soldered to controller.

It was cut with laser cutter from 2mm plywood.
It has to be thick enough to cover the pins of the controller and switches (pins are in row/holes but still plywood has
to be thicker that length of the pins sticking out from pcb).
